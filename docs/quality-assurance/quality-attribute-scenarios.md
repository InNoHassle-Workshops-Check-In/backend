# Quality Attribute Scenarios

This document defines the quality characteristics and scenarios for the WorkshopsAPI project based on ISO 25010 model. After team analysis and customer consultation, we have identified the following three critical quality sub-characteristics:

## Functional Suitability

### Functional Completeness

**Why it's important to our customer:**
Functional completeness ensures that the WorkshopsAPI provides all the features required for workshop management, user registration, and check-in processes. Our customer needs a complete solution that handles the entire workshop lifecycle without requiring additional tools or manual processes.

**Response Measure**: 100% of workshop management operations complete successfully within 2 seconds

**How to execute**: 
1. Create a new workshop with all required fields
2. Update workshop details (name, capacity, dates)
3. Activate/deactivate workshop status
4. Delete workshop and verify cleanup
5. Verify all operations return appropriate HTTP status codes and response data

#### Scenario: User Registration and Authentication
**Source**: Users need to register and authenticate with the system
**Stimulus**: User registration and login processes
**Environment**: Normal operation with secure authentication

**Response**: Users can register, login, and access protected resources
**Response Measure**: Authentication succeeds for 99.9% of valid credentials within 1 second

**How to execute**:
1. Register a new user with valid credentials
2. Attempt login with correct credentials
3. Attempt login with incorrect credentials
4. Access protected endpoints with valid tokens
5. Verify token expiration and refresh mechanisms

## Performance Efficiency

### Time Behavior

**Why it's important to our customer:**
Time behavior is critical for user experience, especially during peak workshop registration periods. Our customer needs the system to respond quickly to ensure smooth workshop check-ins and prevent user frustration during high-traffic events.

#### Scenario: Workshop Check-in Performance
**Source**: Multiple users checking into workshops simultaneously
**Stimulus**: Concurrent check-in requests for the same workshop
**Environment**: High load with 100+ concurrent users
**Artifact**: Workshop check-in system
**Response**: Check-in requests are processed quickly and accurately
**Response Measure**: 95% of check-in requests complete within 500ms, with no data inconsistencies

**How to execute**:
1. Set up load testing with 100+ concurrent users
2. Simulate check-in requests for the same workshop
3. Measure response times for each request
4. Verify database consistency after concurrent operations
5. Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, database connections)

#### Scenario: Database Query Performance
**Source**: Users browsing available workshops
**Stimulus**: Multiple users querying workshop listings simultaneously
**Environment**: Normal operation with database load
**Artifact**: Workshop listing and search functionality
**Response**: Workshop queries return results quickly
**Response Measure**: 90% of workshop queries complete within 200ms

**How to execute**:
1. Create test data with 1000+ workshops
2. Execute concurrent queries for workshop listings
3. Measure query execution times
4. Analyze database query plans
5. Optimize slow queries if needed

## Reliability

### Fault Tolerance

**Why it's important to our customer:**
Fault tolerance ensures the system continues operating even when individual components fail. Our customer needs the WorkshopsAPI to remain available during critical workshop events, preventing service disruptions that could impact workshop attendance and user experience.

#### Scenario: Database Connection Resilience
**Source**: Temporary database connectivity issues
**Stimulus**: Database connection failure during operation
**Environment**: Network instability or database maintenance
**Artifact**: Database connection management
**Response**: System gracefully handles connection failures and retries operations
**Response Measure**: System remains operational during 99% of database connection issues, with automatic recovery within 30 seconds

**How to execute**:
1. Simulate database connection failures
2. Monitor system behavior during failures
3. Verify automatic retry mechanisms
4. Test connection pool management
5. Measure recovery time after connection restoration

#### Scenario: Invalid Input Handling
**Source**: Users providing invalid or malformed data
**Stimulus**: Invalid workshop data or malformed requests
**Environment**: Normal operation with various input types
**Artifact**: Input validation and error handling
**Response**: System gracefully handles invalid inputs and provides meaningful error messages
**Response Measure**: 100% of invalid inputs are caught and handled without system crashes

**How to execute**:
1. Submit requests with invalid JSON payloads
2. Test with missing required fields
3. Provide invalid data types (strings where numbers expected)
4. Test with extremely large payloads
5. Verify error responses are consistent and informative

#### Scenario: Concurrent Data Modification
**Source**: Multiple users modifying the same workshop simultaneously
**Stimulus**: Concurrent updates to workshop capacity or details
**Environment**: High concurrency with database transactions
**Artifact**: Data consistency and transaction management
**Response**: System maintains data consistency and prevents race conditions
**Response Measure**: 100% of concurrent modifications maintain data integrity

**How to execute**:
1. Simulate concurrent updates to the same workshop
2. Test capacity modifications during check-ins
3. Verify database transaction isolation
4. Check for deadlock prevention
5. Validate final data state after concurrent operations

## Security

### Confidentiality

**Why it's important to our customer:**
Confidentiality ensures that sensitive user data and workshop information are protected from unauthorized access. Our customer needs to comply with data protection regulations and maintain user trust.

#### Scenario: JWT Token Security
**Source**: Authentication token handling
**Stimulus**: Token generation, validation, and expiration
**Environment**: Secure communication over HTTPS
**Artifact**: JWT token management system
**Response**: Tokens are securely generated, validated, and properly expired
**Response Measure**: 100% of token operations follow security best practices

**How to execute**:
1. Generate tokens with proper expiration times
2. Validate token signatures and claims
3. Test token expiration handling
4. Verify secure token storage
5. Test token refresh mechanisms

#### Scenario: API Endpoint Authorization
**Source**: Access to protected API endpoints
**Stimulus**: Requests to admin-only or user-specific endpoints
**Environment**: Normal operation with role-based access
**Artifact**: Authorization middleware
**Response**: Endpoints properly enforce access controls based on user roles
**Response Measure**: 100% of unauthorized access attempts are properly rejected

**How to execute**:
1. Test admin endpoints with user tokens
2. Test user endpoints with admin tokens
3. Test endpoints with expired tokens
4. Test endpoints with invalid tokens
5. Verify proper HTTP status codes for unauthorized access

## Usability

### Understandability

**Why it's important to our customer:**
Understandability ensures that the API is easy to use and integrate with frontend applications. Our customer needs clear, well-documented endpoints that developers can easily understand and implement.

#### Scenario: API Documentation Quality
